## Deep Learning for Multi-Labeled Cyberbully Detection: Enhancing Online Safety

Abstract—Social media platforms offer undeniable benefits,
but the preservation of anonymity has led to the emergence
of cyberbullying, a concerning social problem. This form of
online harassment creates a negative and hostile environment,
resulting in decreased user engagement and psychological harm
to victims. According to ResearchGate and ScienceDaily, cyberbullying
victims in the United States are 1.9 times more
likely to commit suicide, highlighting the severity of the issue.
However, the current research on cyberbullying detection has
been limited to binary/multi-class text classification due to the
lack of comprehensive datasets for training and evaluation.
To address this gap, we developed a DL-based multi-labeled
cyberbully detection system using a dataset of 95,608 social
media comments. These comments were categorized into five
distinct multi-labeled classes, allowing for a more comprehensive
understanding of the different dimensions of cyberbullying. We
utilized DL architectures, such as LSTM, BiLSTM, CLSTM,
and BiGRU, to develop advanced cyberbully detection systems.
By comparing the performance of these DL models with the
ML models, we were able to assess the effectiveness and superiority
of DL approaches in accurately identifying instances of
cyberbullying content. The CLSTM model, outperformed the
others with an exceptional binary accuracy of 87.8% and a
macro f1-score of 88.3%. CLSTM’s ability to integrate both local
and sequential information, coupled with its capacity to capture
complex patterns and long-term dependencies, contributes to its
superior performance in identifying and classifying cyberbullying
instances. By successfully identifying and preventing cyberbullying,
our study can contribute to creating a safer and more positive
online environment, ultimately enhancing user engagement and
satisfaction.
